    "## Lending Club\n",
    "Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each borrower completes a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data and their own data science process to assign an interest rate to the borrower. The interest rate is the percent in addition to the requested loan amount the borrower has to pay back.\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher interest rate means that the borrower is a risk and more unlikely to pay back the loan. While a lower interest rate means that the borrower has a good credit history and is more likely to pay back the loan. The interest rates range from 5.32% all the way to 30.99% and each borrower is given a grade according to the interest rate they were assigned. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are primarily interested in receiving a return on their investments. Approved loans are listed on the Lending Club website, where qualified investors can browse recently approved loans, the borrower's credit score, the purpose for the loan, and other information from the application. Once they're ready to back a loan, they select the amount of money they want to fund. Once a loan's requested amount is fully funded, the borrower receives the money they requested minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The borrower will make monthly payments back to Lending Club either over 36 months or over 60 months. Lending Club redistributes these payments to the investors. This means that investors don't have to wait until the full amount is paid off before they see a return in money. If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition to the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time and some borrowers default on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?"
